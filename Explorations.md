<p> Hello, I am Saish Karole, currently pursuing B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology) in Electronics Engineering at Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai. For me, going into college was like throwing a fish, who only knew his fish bowl, into a vast ocean of domains I could explore and number of opportunities they can lead too. However, I swam towards the areas that sit at the intersection of performance, efficiency and system-level design, most notably  Computer Architecture </p>

<p> In abstract terms, Hardware and Software is needed for a computer to function a given task. Computer Architecture is the design of the implementation layers that will allow to execute information coming from the software effciently using the given hardware. I find this domain very important and think that it will play a bigger role in the upcoming future as both Hardware and software advancements will force the growth of available architectures. I believe architectural innovation will play a critical role in sustaining performance and energy efficiency as traditional scaling slows. </p>

<p> Alongside this, I actively work with FPGAs, which provide a unique platform to prototype and evaluate architectural ideas at a fine-grained hardware level. FPGAs or Field Programmable Gate Arrays is a type of configurable integrated circuit that can be repeatedly programmed after manufacturing. They're referred to as 'field programmable' because they provide users the ability to reconfigure the hardware to meet specific use case requirements after the manufacturing process. We can test our designs on FPGA fabric by programming it using a Hardware Descriptive Language (HDL). One can say we can test our design using a Microcontroller. Yes, we can but a Microcontroller is customizable on a superficial level, having a fixed hardware structure and low processing power.
Meanwhile FPGAs are ideal for complex operations that require more processing power and allows us to customize it on a lower level which makes it suitable for testing a CPU design and hardware accelerators</p>

<p> My current research interests include <b>Computer Architecture, AI-driven hardware design, memory systems, and learning-based methods for high-efficiency computing</b>. I am especially interested in applying machine learning techniques to architectural problems. I have pursued several projects in these areas under the guidance of senior mentors, which further strengthened my inclination toward research-driven system design. </p>

<p> I am an avid learner and have done some projects related to my interests under the guidance of my seniors who introduced me to these domains, feel free to check it out. I am also always open to discussions, collaborations, and opportunities related to architecture research, RTL design, and learning-based methods to improve system's performance. Feel free to connect if you would like to discuss ideas or my previous work.</p>

<p>I also like to play video games, table tennis and watch movies in free time.</p>
