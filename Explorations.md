			<h2>Along-Tract Analysis of Cerebellar Pathways in MCI and AD</h2>
		</header>
		<p><strong>Duration:</strong> April 2024 - July 2024<br>
		<strong>Supervisor:</strong> Dr. Samira Raminfard</p>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>The cerebellum's role in cognition is increasingly recognized, but how do its cortical connections degrade in Alzheimer's? I worked on extracting and analyzing cerebellar white matter tracts to quantify structural changes.</p>

				<strong>Figure 1.</strong> A: CPC-L (Cortico-Ponto-Cerebellar Left), B: CPC-R (Cortico-Ponto-Cerebellar Right), C: CTC-L (Cerebello-Thalamo-Cortical Left), D: CTC-R (Cerebello-Thalamo-Cortical Right)
			</p>
		</span>
		<h3>Methods</h3>
		<p>Used exploreDTI to isolate cortico-ponto-cerebellar (cortex → cerebellum) and cerebello-thalamo-cortical (cerebellum → cortex) pathways. Calculated FA (fractional anisotropy), MD (mean diffusivity), RD (radial diffusivity), and AD (axial diffusivity) along tract profiles. Set up comparison pipeline between MCI and AD patient groups.</p>
		<h3>What I Learned</h3>
		<p>This project taught me the technical challenges of working with diffusion imaging—tract extraction requires careful parameter tuning, and artifacts can easily confound results. More conceptually: we measure water diffusion as a proxy for white matter integrity. But what are we actually capturing? Structural damage, yes—but does degraded structure tell us about how the network compensates? How information still flows despite damage? The metrics felt static, snapshots of decline, not the dynamic story of how a brain adapts. This tension between structure and function is what keeps pulling me toward questions about networks and communication.</p>
		<p><strong>Tools:</strong> exploreDTI, MATLAB, diffusion MRI analysis, tractography</p>
