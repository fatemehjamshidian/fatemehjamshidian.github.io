I paint until I forget time exists. I think about brains as worlds, how neurons connect like people in a city, how communication emerges from networks. I worked with graph theory before, but now I'm asking different questions: if the brain is a world, how do its inhabitants really talk to each other? I'm a student, a painter, someone who writes haiku about sky life. I want to understand connections in brain networks, in human networks, in the three hours I stand at a canvas and don't notice passing. This site is where all of that lives.
