    <ul>
        <li>
        <h3>Q-Cache - A Deep Q-learning guided Cache replacement policy &emsp; <a href="https://github.com/NachtSpyder04/Q-Cache" class="icon fa-github"><span class="label">Github</span></a></h3>
            <p> Designed a Deep Reinforcement Learning–based cache replacement policy that learns how to evict cache blocks and compare its performance with traditional methods such as LRU, LFU, and Random and evaluated Q-Cache across multiple synthetic access patterns such as Zipf, Loop, Bursty, Markov, Stride, and Mixed traces. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Research Implementation - CycleGANs &emsp; <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JwZDm4rFW0z7xY5hc_yKYu7-b00tEfr8?usp=sharing" class="icon fa-solid fa-play"><span class="label">Github</span></a></h3>
            <p> Re-implemented CycleGAN from the original paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593">(Zhu et al.)</a> for unpaired image-to-image translation (Horses to Zebras and vice versa) and achieved realistic style transfer with preserved structure in training outputs after 45 epochs. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Matrix Multiplication on FPGA &emsp; <a href="https://github.com/NachtSpyder04/Matrix_Multiplication_on_FPGA" class="icon fa-github"><span class="label">Github</span></a></h3>
            <p> Implemented a matrix multiplication algorithm in Verilog HDL and a C kernel for FPGA-based hardware acceleration using Vitis IDE. Deployed the design on the Kria KV260 Vision AI Starter Kit and verified functionality and performance. </p>
        </li>    
        <li>
        <h3>Chisel Digital Designs &emsp; <a href="https://github.com/NachtSpyder04/chisel-digital-designs" class="icon fa-github"><span class="label">Github</span></a></h3>
            <p> Learned Chisel HDL and its functions. Designed and verified basic digital circuits, including adders and encoders, using ScalaTest simulations. </p>
        </li> 
        <li>
        <h3>E-yantra - Astro-Tinker Robot &emsp; <a href="https://github.com/RapidRoger18/E-yantra_Astrotinker-bot" class="icon fa-github"><span class="label">Github</span></a></h3>
            <p> Constructed a Pick and Place and Line Following robot to use in an arena that represents an scenario of a space station with a team of four and implemented a single cycle RISC-V RV32I core, written in Verilog HDL that can execute C codes, compiled into hexadecimal instructions for the CPU using the RISC-V cross-compiler. We executed a Dijkstra's Algorithm written in C on the RISC-V CPU to find the shortest path between two locations in the arena and navigation was achieved by a Line following Algorithm, implementing a PID controller for the same.This was programmed on the DE0-Nano development board consisting of Intel Cyclone-IV FPGA with the help of Intel Quartus Prime Lite and Modelsim Altera </p>

        <li>
        <h3>RISC-V CPU &emsp; <a href="https://github.com/SRA-VJTI/synapse32/" class="icon fa-github"><span class="label">Github</span></a></h3>
            <p>Designed a RISC-V core supporting RV32IM extensions in Verilog HDL from scratch. This CPU was tested on UPduino 3.0 board using Yosys suite and IceStorm toolchain by successfully executing a fibonacci series by connecting output GPIOs to a Seven Segment Display.</p>
